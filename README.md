### Strategy

**Project Goals:**

* The goal is to create an online fitness community that inspires and helps people take control over their own fitness journey. The name "You Made You Fitness Community" is meant to reflect this.

* The community will offer different science based meal plans and workout plans for all levels of fitness, in addition to community specific merchandise. Quality is key and all plans have to be proven to work. The community site needs to reflect a business that values high quality.

* The target audicence is people who are looking for tools to take charge of their fitness journey while also sharing the experience with a community. Previous fitness level does not matter as different plans for different goals are offered. Everyone is welcome.

**User Expectations:**

* Accessibility for all users.
* Easy navigation throughout the site.
* The purpose of the site is clear.
* A webshop where the products are relevant, clearly displayed and easy to browse through.
* A simple and safe checkout process.
* A visually pleasing design with pleasing color contrasts.


### Scope

**Contet Requirements and Functional Specification:**

Requirements:

* Authentication: Functionality to register and manage an account. 
* Web Shop: Functionality to complete a purchase.
* Products: Images and descriptions.
* Functional Design: Responsiveness throughout the site.

Initially Not Included:

* The blog and its functionality will only be implemented if the time limit allows it, and is therefore not a priority. User stories related to the blog are therefore labeled "could have". The developer's lack of experience with ecommerce projects makes it difficult to ensure that the time will be enough.

**Content Requirements:**

**Keyword Research:**

1. Pen and paper were used to brainstorm general topics and possible keywords.
![screenshot of keyword brainstorm](/documentation/images/SEO-keywords-brainstorm.png)
2. A Google search was made for each keyword and the relevant results were documented in tables. Some of the keywords from the brainstorming were deleted/modified as they were too general.
![google search result presented in table](/documentation/images/SEO-google-search-1.png)
![google search result presented in table](/documentation/images/SEO-google-search-2.png)
![google search result presented in table](/documentation/images/SEO-google-search-3.png)
3. A mix of 10 short and long-tail keywords were selected based on the Google search results.
4. The relevance and authoritativeness was checked for some keywords using **[wordtracker](https://www.wordtracker.com/)** (I checked as many as I could before running out of free searches).

## Features

The "Need Some Guidance" section links to the webshop and is avaliable for both registered and unregistered user.

### Shopping Cart

If there are items in the shopping cart, an overview of what is in the cart is displayed together with the cart total (the "bag" has been changed to "cart" since the screenshot was taken to keep it consitent). If the user wants to delete an item from the cart they can click the trash can icon. In addition to the order overview there are two buttons: one linking back to the webshop and one linking to the checkout page.

![screenshot of empty cart](/documentation/images/cart-empty.png)

### Checkout

The checkout page is where the user completes a purchase. An order summary is displayed and the user is prompted to fill out their information to complete the purchase. Since there are no physical products (digital only) available the user does not have to fill out their address. Name, number, email and card information is enough.

![screenshot of checkout view](/documentation/images/checkout-view.png)

When an order has been completed, a checkout success page is displayed with an order summary. 

![screenshot of checkout success page](/documentation/images/checkout-success.png)

The community page for an unregistered user links to login and signup.

![screenshot of community page unauthorized users](/documentation/images/community-unauthorized.png)

For a registered user, the community page links to three sections: read posts, add posts, and the posts specific to the logged in user. For reading and adding there are three categories available: recipes, workouts and other posts. There is also a search bar available.

![screenshot of community start page](/documentation/images/community-start-page.png)

If the user clicks on one of buttons under "read other memebers posts" they are relocated to a post overview specific for the category they picked. The posts are displayed evenly with a default image, a title, author and "created on" date. The user can click on a title to read the post. In addition, there are two buttons available: one to add a post and one to go back to the community start page.

The post detail page contains the actual blog post and a button linking back to the post overview page.

Under "your blog posts" the posts specific to the logged in user are displayed. The main CRUD functionality is available on this page as the user can edit and/or delete their posts. If there are no posts in a category a "there are no posts" message is displayed.

The form for adding a post consists of different fields depending on category. The form presented below is for creating a general blog post.

The form for editing a post looks similar to the "add a post" form, but is prepopulated with the content of the post that is getting edited.

* Click "Use this template" and pick "Create a new repository".
* Add a name for your repository.
* Click the green "Create repository" button.
* Create a workspace for the new repository. I used Codeanywhere.

<h4>Install Django and Supporting Libraries</h4>

* Open up the workspace.
* Install Django: in the terminal, type "pip3 install 'django<4' gunicorn".
* Library for PostgreSQL: in the terminal, type: "pip3 install dj_database_url==0.5.0 psycopg2".
* Library for Cloudinary: in the terminal, type: "pip3 install dj3-cloudinary-storage".
* Make sure to create a requirements.txt file by using the command: "pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt".

* Click the purple "Create app" button.

<h4>Cloudinary</h4>

* Log in/Sign up to **[Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)**.

* In the env.py file, add "import os", a blank line, and then "os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]=copiedURL".
* Replace "copiedURL" with the string copied from ElephantSQL.
* Below the DATABASE_URL line, add "os.environ["SECRET_KEY"]="asecretkey".
* Replace "asecretkey" with a secret key of your choice (inside quotation marks).
* Add a variable called "os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"]". This is where the copied variable from cloudinary is added as value.
* Make sure to delete "CLOUDINARY_URL=" from the copied variable before saving.
* Add variables for stripe secret and public keys.
